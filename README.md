# Lenovo-G570-Hackintosh
[WIP] MacOS High Sierra on Lenovo G570 (20079) using the OpenCore Bootloader 0.8.9
Can also boot Mojave (preferred) and Catalina optionally with dosdude1's patched installers.
(you need to patch some things manually without patched installer)
# CAUTION
IMAC SMBIOS DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY, DON'T EVER TRY TO GET SUPPORT, IT'S UNUSABLE
- TESTED ON: CATALINA AND [BIG SUR](https://codeberg.org/satan/HackintoshNext-G570)
## [DISCLAIMER]
Before you proceed any further, you, the reader and a probable user of this EFI, accept that all changes that you are willing to perform on 
your personal G570 computer are at your own risk, and that I will NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE if you managed to summon 
a nuke to your location or if you managed to bring world peace by letting aliens take over our planet... 
(the irony)
That said, if your G570's specifications are as accurate as mine, it shouldn't be a problem using this EFI OOTB. Adapt this EFI to your laptop
with due diligence and use responsibly.
## ——————————
Hello, true believers and newcomers alike!
Here is the EFI that I used to get MacOS working on my Lenovo G570 (20079).
I currently use Catalina. Thus, some information here is adopted for Catalina ONLY! I will try to include more for <10.15.x

# Notes:
- EFI is up to date, but you need to do more stuff.
- GenSMBIOS for serial (patch as MBP8,1 or MBP10,1)
- OC beauty treatment -> resources folder -> paste accordingly

# Tested on:
#### NeoBlizzard
- macOS: 10.15.7
- SMBIOS: MacBookPro8,1
- CPU: Intel Core i3 2310M
- GPU: Intel HD 3000 (iGPU only, no dGPU for me)
- RAM: 8GB (2x4GB) Samsung DDR3L RAM
- SSD: Crucial MX250
- Audio: Conexant CX20590
- Bluetooth: Broadcom Bluetooth 2.1+EDR
- WiFi card: BCM94322HM8L
- ACPI\VPC2004 YogaSMC included
- 1366x768 BOE display panel
- Unlocked BIOS ADV+NWL (40CN33WW)

#### incycledream
- macOS: 10.15.7
- SMBIOS: MacPro5,1
- CPU: Intel Core i5 2410M
- GPU: Intel HD 3000, Radeon HD 3670M (384 > 2048 MB patch)
- RAM: 4GB (2x2GB) Samsung DDR3L RAM
- SSD: Apacer Panther AS340
- Audio: Conexant CX20590
- Bluetooth: Broadcom Bluetooth 2.1+EDR
- WiFi card: Atheros AR9285
- ACPI\VPC2004 YogaSMC included
- 1366x768 BOE display panel
- Locked BIOS (40CN33WW)

# Notes/observations:
- Legacy systems can't boot GPT. But, OpenCore can only boot GPT boot drives and thus, duetpkg will be used automagically by OpenCorePkg.
- Press the power button twice to boot laptop from a shutdown if you have ADV+NWL BIOS
- Post installation, disable SIP and use the BootInstallx64.command found in "Utilities" to patch the boot drive 
    so that the laptop can be booted without the USB drive.
The above step is important as (in my experience) the NVRAM patch works only when the EFI is in the boot drive, but not when booting off of USB.
- To fix sleep, use XOSI SSDT. However, sleep acts weird. When the device is woke up post sleep, it boots back to BIOS and then to OS.
(Maybe it doesn't know the boot drive UUID?) 
I WON'T FIX SLEEP
- All SSDTs are compiled. No prebuilts were used.
Fixed SMBusPCI, NumLockIndicator, ECRW on YogaSMC with battery notifier when Conservative mode is enabled (Thanks to oc-little guide)
- Thanks to 1Revenger1 for ultimate fixes to the Synaptics touchpad. However, Touchpad is wonky for a while after booting. Eventually works good.
- Mapped USB for Catalina, USE USBMAP TO EDIT THE IOCLASS FOR VERSIONS LOWER THAN CATALINA!!
- Too many controls to control brightness. I gave up eliminating the others since I stopped bothering.
- Display artefacts exist, even after patches. Even EDID patching didn't help.
- Occasional freezes when multitasking heavily, so, tread lightly (ig?)
- Tried to fix resolution during picker but gave up.
- Inbuilt Keyboard does not work in OpenCore boot menu. Internal trackpad and external keyboard/mouse work fine. 
- Resolution and inbuilt keyboard works properly if OpenCore is booted from EDK DUET older than 2020. (See cheatsheet below)
# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeoBlizzard-verbose/Lenovo-G570-Hackintosh/main/Quick%20Table-1_EDIT_1.png">
- Boot chime enabled. Using VoodooHDA as it has internal mic working. Mic port is still dead and I don't have any interest to write custom AppleALC codec
