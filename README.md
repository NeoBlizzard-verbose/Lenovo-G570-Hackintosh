# Lenovo-G570-Hackintosh
[WIP] MacOS High Sierra on Lenovo G570 (20079) using the OpenCore Bootloader 0.8.9
Can also boot Mojave (preferred) and Catalina optionally with dosdude1's patched installers.
(you need to patch some things manually without patched installer)

# Notes:
- EFI is up to date, but you need to do more stuff.
- GenSMBIOS for serial (patch as MBP8,1 or MBP10,1)
- OC beauty treatment -> resources folder -> paste accordingly
