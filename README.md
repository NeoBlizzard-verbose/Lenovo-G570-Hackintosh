# Lenovo-G570-Hackintosh
[WIP] MacOS High Sierra on Lenovo G570 (20079) using the OpenCore Bootloader 

[DISCLAIMER]
Before you proceed any further, you, the reader and a probable user of this EFI, accept that all changes that you are willing to perform on 
your personal G570 computer are at your own risk, and that I will NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE if you managed to summon 
a nuke to your location or if you managed to bring world peace by letting aliens take over our planet... 
(the irony)

Hello, true believers and newcomers alike!
Here is the EFI that I used to get Hackintosh High Sierra working on my Lenovo G570 20079

My Specs:-
Core i3 2310M
iHD 3000 (iGPU only, no dGPU for me)
8GB (2x4GB) Samsung DDR3L RAM
Crucial MX250 SSD
Dying keyboard
nice battery (90% health xd)
moar?

Notes/observations:- 
1.) Legacy systems can't boot GPT. But, OpenCore can only boot GPT boot drives and thus, duetpkg will be used.
2.) Post installation, disable SIP and use the BootInstallx64.command found in Utilities to flash the boot drive 
    so that the laptop can be booted without the USB drive.
> The above step is important as (in my experience) the nvram patch works only when the EFI is in the boot drive, but not when booting off of USB.
3.) To fix sleep, use XOSI SSDT. However, sleep acts weird. When the device is woke up post sleep, it boots back to BIOS and then to OS.
(Maybe it doesn't know the boot drive UUID?) 
4.) All SSDTs are self-compiled. No prebuilts were used. So, I'm omitting them from my repo. The list of SSDTs required will be posted soon on the wiki?
5.) Touchpad is wonky right after booting. It settles after a while but deadzones are fucked. Buttons work using the kext included in this repo. (Thanks to 1Revenger1)
6.) My wifi card is cooked, I don't know why. It works. Period. 
7.) Native b0rightness control keys (fn + up-down arrow keys) do not work, (me leji to do ACPI edits /patches watever) managed to remap brightness keys shortcuts to F6 and F7 from system settings but this option disappeared after injecting edid via hackintool (removing it did not work, so did rebuilding kext cache)
8.) Occasional glitches to the UI and a freeze when AppStore is loaded in the background. Meh, pretty common for me on Windows so I didn't bother.
    Hey, on the plus side, I get MacOS and three-finger gestures, so, the bugs can be ignored in my case, YMMV. 
9.) Inbuilt mic is fucked, along with external 3.5mm mic. BT is da wae? or Camo Studio yay!
10.) Used the lenovo T470 AppleHDA layout-id as it is identical. 
11.) Don't forget to enable TRIM else SSD fuck-up soon...
12.) Used ECEnabler for fixing battery readouts
13.) Keyboard does not work in OpenCore boot menu, external usb keyboard works, but not mouse. On the contrary, native mouse works, not keyboard. Pathetic.

Changelog:-
> 20 November 2022
The blind build is back, except it is now more raw and messed up.
But hey, it boots, so, profit?
I blame incycledream for guilting me into doing this again. Wrapped it up in 2 hrs. tops, nice record xD
There's a lot of work to do, NGL. Checklist soon

> 4th March 2022
placed files needed for duetpkg to read OCBL.
USB boots (finally) but throws a kernel panic error, which i cannot fix with my expertise rn

> 3 March 2022 = fail
WIP! NOT READY! WILL BE, SOON...
PS:- I had more luck booting off of a blunt USB on the first try than this calculated approach. How ironic
