# Lenovo-G570-Hackintosh
[WIP] MacOS High Sierra on Lenovo G570 (20079) using OpenCore

Hello, true believers and newcomers alike!
Here is the EFI that I will be using to get Hackintosh OC High Sierra to work on my Lenovo G570 20079

My Specs:-
Core i3 2310M
iHD 3000 (iGPU only, no dGPU for me) (sad noises)
8GB (2x4GB DDR3L)
Crucial MX250 SSD
dying keyboard
nice battery
moar?

Notes/observations:- 
Legacy systems can't boot GPT, but the usage of GPT USB is unavoidable because that's the M.O of OCBL.
Using bootice, duetpkg will be flashed which gets written @ the MBR and PBR of boot USB, enabling users to boot GPT on legacy
(intuitive, indeed)
This device does not need USB patching IMO (Please, CMIIW. I don't "explicitly" remember applying USB Patches)
IRQ is self-compiled and ACPI-patched in config.plist, rest are prebuilt.

Changelog:-
> 20 November 2022
The blind build is back, except it is now more raw and messed up.
But hey, it boots, so, profit?
I blame incycledream for guilting me into doing this again. Wrapped it up in 2 hrs. tops, nice record xD
There's a lot of work to do, NGL. Checklist soon

> 4th March 2022
placed files needed for duetpkg to read OCBL.
USB boots (finally) but throws a kernel panic error, which i cannot fix with my expertise rn

> 3 March 2022 = fail
WIP! NOT READY! WILL BE, SOON...
PS:- I had more luck booting off of a blunt USB on the first try than this calculated approach. How ironic
